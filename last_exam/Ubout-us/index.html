                North London native  Elena Tonra (born 15 January 1990), <br>
                they were formed in 2010 after the addition  of Swiss-born <br>

        <h2 class="box2_title">HISTORY</h2>
        <div class="box2_content">
            <div>
                <p>Of Irish–Italian parentage, Elena Tonra was raised in Northwood, London. Through her Dublin-born grandfather she experienced traditional Irish music from an early age. Her interest in music began when she received a copy of the album Grace by Jeff Buckley. After being bullied at school she used writing to "deal emotionally with life". Changing schools at the age of 12 had a great impact and since then Tonra writes "about things I feel difficult talking about in adulthood”.
                </p>
                <p>Tonra began her career in music by performing acoustic shows under her own name around London. She found that this "didn't suit me at all. As a musician, I'm self-taught and felt I was restricted by my abilities". Haefeli attended one of the acoustic shows that Tonra was performing and found that "she had this power which drew everyone in". Originally from Neuchatel, Haefeli also attended London's Institute of Contemporary Music Performance where he met Tonra during a songwriting course. They began performing together with Haefeli adding electric guitars. After their first demo started word of mouth on the band, Daughter self-released their debut EP, His Young Heart, on 20 April 2011, recorded in Haefeli's bedsit. Later that same year, they released another EP, The Wild Youth, on 2 October through artist-led Communion Records.

                <p>
                    Tonra and Haefeli became romantically involved and the guitarist insisted that they "keep our couple life and our band life separate, I don’t want Elena to stop saying things in her songs that are personal songwriters need to be expansive and they need to be unafraid”. While Tonra concurred with "Igor doesn’t question my lyrics. He regards what we do as an art form. He certainly doesn’t try to rewrite my words. I never tell anyone what my songs are about, not even him. I feel they are direct enough, anyway. They aren’t especially obscure". Tonra and Haefeli ended their relationship before the release of their album If You Leave in 2013.
                </p>
                <p>In 2012, shortly after headlining a 700-capacity show in London, Daughter announced their signing to UK label 4AD. Speaking of this, Elena commented "we couldn't be happier to be working with 4AD, a label that has released so many inspirational records and whose ethos we hold in very high regard. It really is a privilege." Their first single proper, "Smother", was released in October of that year. It was playlisted by both BBC Radio 1 and 6Music, while being awarded Single of the Week by long-time supporter Huw Stephens. In December 2012 the band appeared on the David Letterman Show prior to the release of the record, which Tonra described as "perhaps (...) a cart-before-the-horse situation".

            <div class="inform_text">Rummer Remi Aguilella might hail from central France, but he certainly doesn't sound like it. From what I made out from his muffled chatter in a phone call from Tokyo — where Daughter was playing at last week — he sounded very, very British. It could be attributed to the fact that he's one-third of the English-language band Daughter — also comprising of Londoner Elena Tonra and Swiss Igor Haefeli — but the Frenchman explained that he has a tendency of copying accents. The trio met while studying music in London, forming the indie folk band in 2010. </div>
